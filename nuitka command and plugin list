Optional Standard Plugins Documentation
dill-compat

    Required by the dill module. Dill extends Python's pickle module for serializing and de-serializing objects.
    Options: none.

eventlet

    Required by the eventlet package. Eventlet is a concurrent networking library.
    Options: none.

gevent

    Required by the gevent package. Gevent is a coroutine-based Python networking library that uses greenlet to provide a high-level synchronous API.
    Options: none.

numpy

    Required for numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, xarray, sklearn, skimage, and most other scientific packages.
    Options: Can disable some of the packages handled, e.g. --enable-plugin=numpy --noinclude-scipy --noinclude-matplotlib which disables the handling to make these actually usable.

pmw-freezer

    Required by the Pmw package. Pmw is a toolkit for building high-level compound widgets.
    Options: none.

pylint-warnings

    Support PyLint / PyDev linting source markers. Python static code analysis tools which help enforcing a coding standard.
    Options: none

pyside2, pyside6, pyqt5

    Required by the PySide and PyQt and GUI packages, only one can be activated at a time.
    Options: With --include-qt-plugins you can select which Qt plugins to include. By default a relatively small set, called sensible that is defined in the code is include, but you can add more, and even all, which will add a terrible amount of dependencies though. But without the proper Qt plugins, functionality of Qt might be broken, crashes can occur, or appearance can be inferior.
    These plugins also inhibit other GUI frameworks from being included in standalone distributions.

tensorflow

    Required by the tensorflow package. TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone. Note that this package requires numpy and potentially many other packages.
    Options: none.

tk-inter

    Required by Python's Tk modules.
    Options: Can override the automatic detection of Tcl and Tk directories with --tk-library-dir and --tcl-library-dir but that should not be needed.

torch

    Required by the torch and torchvision packages. Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration. Torchvision requires numpy.
    Options: none.
